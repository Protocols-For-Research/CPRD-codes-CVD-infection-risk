*Readme Antihypertensives and beta blockers - CPRD codes 2022

*These files are to identify patients likely to be taking systemic antihypertensives and rate limiting drugs (beta blockers and rate limiting calcium channel blockers). Drugs that don't do this, e.g vasodiltors for anal fissue, or eye drops are not included. Only drugs for use in primary care are included.

*Whilst beta blockers or rate limiting calcium channel blockers can be used as hypertensives, and some studies class them as such, they also have other uses (heart failure, arrythmias etc.) and are barely used for hypertension these days. Keeping them separate allows a choice to be made later. 

*The list was made by JJL (a GP) via this process (Search_strategies_browsers.do):
*1. Opening a cleaned (lower case, relabelled) Aurum browser product text file
*2. Searching for BNF chapters 
*3. Searching for drug names 
*4. Excluding inappropriate modes of admninistration 
*5. Manually checking the list
*6. Using the same code in a cleaned Gold browser file
*7. Checking this file (and updating both searches as needed)
