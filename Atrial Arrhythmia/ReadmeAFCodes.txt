***AF readme 1/4/22

***These code lists are designed to identify atrial flutter,  atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia codes in the primary care records, for a project concerning infection-related CVD. 

***Note, this is to identify people with diagnoses, not those referred for care who might turn out not to have AF. Those with past AF are also included, given the natural history of it. Ablations for flutter are very successful, but it has been included anyway, as there are 


***They were originally derived from UK goverment published lists of snomed codes for CVD QoF rules - the 2021 PCD_Refset_Content files published by NHS Digital. These were examined to identify acute relevant events, and then translated to codes for Gold and Aurum. SNOMED codes were translated to CPRD medcodes by merging on both readcodes and terms, and resulting lists were supplemented with additional term searches using the CPRD Gold and Aurum dictionaries. 

***Further search terms were used to screen the broswer files, and codes such as these were excluded:

referral to atrial fibrillation clinic
atrial fibrillation care pathway
provision of written information about atrial fibrillation
atrial fibrillation excluded
