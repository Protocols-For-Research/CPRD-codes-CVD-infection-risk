***Readme dementia

***These code lists are designed to identify dementia in the primary care recors. Not risk of dmementia, use of screening tests or referrals to clinics.  So moderately specific rather than sensitive.

*They were originally derived from UK goverment published lists of snomed codes for CVD QoF rules - the 2021 PCD_Refset_Content files published by NHS Digital. These were examined to identify acute relevant events, and then translated to codes for Gold and Aurum. SNOMED codes were translated to CPRD medcodes by merging on both readcodes and terms, and resulting lists were supplemented with additional term searches using the CPRD Gold and Aurum dictionaries. 

***included, broadly speaking: any dementia, reviews of dementia, several other conditions like Huntingdon's that lead to dementia

***not included: dementia tests and clinics, where a diagnosis may or may not end up being made
