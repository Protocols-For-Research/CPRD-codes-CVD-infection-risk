****Readme for Peripheral vascular disease codelists 080322

*these codes are designed to identify people with arterial peripheral vascualr diseases in the GP records of CPRD Gold and Aurum. 

*The outcome of the project is coronary events and cerebrovascular events. This is unlike many projects where peripheral vascular disease is considered a CVD outcome. This PVD list is therefore supposed  interested in macrovascular disease of arteries, and arterial thromboembolic events, that might well be correlated with coronary or cerebrovascular disease. Operations thought likely to be used in atherosclerotic disease are therefore included, but some descriptions thought likely to represent repair after traumatic events have been excluded. This will not be a 100% accurate set of assumptions. Inflamation of vessels e.g. 'aortitis due to other', disease of capilliaries, arterioles, and veins are excluded. Consequences of peripheral vascular disease, such as gangrene, are included. 

*The list was built on published lists of CTV3 codes from the open-safely website, and published by NHS digital in their 2021 July QoF ruleset of snomed codes, with term and code matching to CPRD codes using their browser files.  Unfortunately CTV codes have odd relationships with CPORD codes, so extra codes completely unrelated to vascualr disease were removed with a script running the terms: raynaud neurogenic acrocyanosis erythromelalgia erythrocyanosis bruce aortography vibratory shock vibration acroparaesthesia actinic beals capilliar retina monckeberg spermato aortogram vagina aortograp erythralgia proteus reconstruction angiogra infant diving injury fibrosis venous dental cylinder jaw coarctation cisticerc cystice myocutaneous capillar orthodont training hernia umbilical developmental advice pregnancy exercise question gases "oral surgeon" screening glaucoma neoplas arterioles "genital organ" "vascular ring" "p.p high" dislocation aortitis" interrupted spasm vaccine influenza
