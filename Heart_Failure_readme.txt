****Readme for Heart Failure codelists

***These codelists were disgned to capture heart failure codes in primary care. Heart failure with a clear code for ischaemic aetiology was not included (this is an outcome in the study for which these were designed). Referrals for echoes/diagnosis were not included (as this doesn't mean the diagnosis has been made).  

*They were originally derived from UK goverment published lists of snomed codes for CVD QoF rules - the 2021 PCD_Refset_Content files published by NHS Digital. These were examined to identify acute relevant events, and then translated to codes for Gold and Aurum. SNOMED codes were translated to CPRD medcodes by merging on both readcodes and terms, and resulting lists were supplemented with additional term searches using the CPRD Gold and Aurum dictionaries.
