***readme for CHD 'Chronic Heart Disease' files (not coronary heart disease)

***These code lists are designed to identify cardiac disease, that is neither heart failure, nor atherosclerotic/ischaemic heart disease (whihc are in separate codelists for our purposes). It was initially based on the snomed codes from the UK government's ruleset for primary care (2021 July version) for identifying patients for whom vaccination is indicated. It has been converted to CPRD codes and these have been screened to remove codes not relevant/shold be in heart failure/ischaemic. 

***included, broadly speaking: valve disease, congenital heart disease, hypertensive disease

***not included: Heart failure, ischaemic disease, coronary atherosclerosis, coronary bypasses, patent foramen ovale (as PFO present in 25% of the population, unless a closure/operation, implying worse disease - likely with a shunt or cryptogenic stroke)
