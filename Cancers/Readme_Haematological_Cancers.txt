***Readme Haematological Cancers

***These code lists are designed to identify haematological malignancies or proliferative disorders in the primary care record. These are for a project predicting risk of infection-related CVD, as a covariate. It is not using linkages to cancer registries, which would likely be needed for studies where cancers are the exposures or outcomes of interest. 

***They were originally derived from UK goverment published lists of snomed codes for CVD QoF rules - the 2021 PCD_Refset_Content files published by NHS Digital. These were examined to identify acute relevant events, and then translated to codes for Gold and Aurum. SNOMED codes were translated to CPRD medcodes by merging on both readcodes and terms, and resulting lists were supplemented with additional term searches using the CPRD Gold and Aurum dictionaries. 

***These lists were then merged with lists kindly provided by Dr Brian Nicholson, Nuffield Dept. Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford. 

***Included - leukaemias, lymphomas, other haematological malignancies and proliferative disorders

***Excluded - solid tumours (see separate codelist)
