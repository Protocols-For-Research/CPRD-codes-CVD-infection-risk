This is a collection of codelists and stuff used for a research project using CPRD data. 

They were developed by a medical practitioner for this purpose. 

The project is about acute respiratory infection-related cardiovascular events. 

They are here because journals and 'open science' bods like to think they could peek if they wanted. 

However, BEWARE! These codelists are not likely to be the ones you need for your CPRD project. 

The codes are here so you can see them, not use them. Although they might be a reasonable starting point. 

If you use these codes as presented you may be missing important codes, or including codes that are not right for your project. 

CPRD change the codes they use willy nilly. 

As a consequence CPRD suggests we use and maintain search strategies, not codelists. 

My advice is that you do not use the CPRD browser to search, which is not easy to use, and won't remember your search strategy. 

To avoid these faults I suggest you use the up to date browser files, but search them with the programme of your choice.
