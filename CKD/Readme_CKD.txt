***Readme CKD

***These code lists are designed to identify chronic renal diseases in the primary care records, for a project concernting infection-related CVD. Whilst some cardiovascular risk scores have used only codes for CKD stages 3 plus, I have expanded this to include other codes that indicate severe chronic failure, like dialysis. Also included are renal syndromes related to severe infections, such as nephrotic syndrome. Other conditions that lead to renal failure were included (Polycystic disease for example). Things coded as acute, or thought to be liekly to be acute (e.g. associated with termination) have been excluded, though some of the nephropathies included may be acute, and some of the acute ones likely led to chronic renal failure. Albuminuria is included for simililar ereasons to nephrotic syndrome. Partial nephrectomies (not likely to have a big impact on renal function) have not been included, but complete nephrectomies are included. A lot of this is a judgement call - trying to be more sensitive than just the CKD codes means the specificity is lower. 

*They were originally derived from UK goverment published lists of snomed codes for CVD QoF rules - the 2021 PCD_Refset_Content files published by NHS Digital. These were examined to identify acute relevant events, and then translated to codes for Gold and Aurum. SNOMED codes were translated to CPRD medcodes by merging on both readcodes and terms, and resulting lists were supplemented with additional term searches using the CPRD Gold and Aurum dictionaries.
